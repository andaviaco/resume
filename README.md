## Summary

Software Developer and self-motivated learner. If I find something interesting I try to learn as much as possible to use it in real-world problems for work, school or personal projects. I like contributing giving my opinion and point of view and have no problem sharing my knowledge, especially with my coworkers. When facing problems, I create clean, simple and practical solutions with the best practices following agile methodologies.

The database was seeded from an Excel file with a script that I wrote to parse, load and save the data with SQLAlchemy.
